# Teaching

At UCSB I teach courses on migration, Middle Eastern politics, and causal inference. In the 2025-26 academic year I will teach a upper-division undergraduate course on Middle Eastern politics.

- “Politics of the Middle East and North Africa” (undergraduate, PS 150A, spring 2026)

Past courses at UCSB include:

- “Causal Inference” (graduate, PS 207, most recently spring 2025)
- “Political Science Senior Honors Program” (undergraduate, PS 197A, 197B and 197C, most recently academic year 2024-25)
- “Migration and Forced Displacement” (senior seminar/graduate, PS 196/594, most recently spring 2022)

During graduate school I served as teaching assistant and section leader for graduate courses in quantitative research methodology, comparative politics, and international relations.

- “Foundations of Statistical Inference” with P. M. Aronow (Yale, spring 2018)
- “The Design and Analysis of Randomized Field Experiments” with Alex Coppock (Yale, spring 2017)
