# Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford University. I have a PhD in Political Science from Yale University, an MPP from Harvard’s Kennedy School, and a BA in Political Science from Bates College.

I study migration, displacement, and humanitarian policy, with a regional focus in the Middle East.

Some of the questions I address in my work include: How do refugees make decisions about when and where to migrate? What are the causes of conflict and peaceful coexistence between refugees and host communities? How do refugees successfully cooperate to support themselves? What interventions effectively promote the well-being of refugees?

My work has appeared in academic journals including the American Political Science Review, British Journal of Political Science, and Journal of Conflict Resolution.

A number of media outlets have covered my research, including The New York Times, The New York Review of Books, The Economist, and The Washington Post.
